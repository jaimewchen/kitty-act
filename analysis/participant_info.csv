[alien] wants your help to find all the [label]s and nothing else! and on trial 3, the label was tibble for a basketball image, and participant repeated the word as ""ti-ball"" instead of ""tibble"" so not sure if that has any effect on how she learned the word (she ended up saying the label meant basketball)",,
